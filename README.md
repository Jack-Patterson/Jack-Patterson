### Hello, my name is Jack Patterson.
I am a third year student doing Computing with Games Devlopment in Muster Technological University Tralee.
I enjoy coding, especially in C#.
I know Java, C#, SQL, HTML, CSS especially well as I have dabbled in a bit of Javascript (NodeJS), PHP, C++ and Lua. I like to just mess around in projects and challenge myself to see what I can do. While not everything is public I also have a Discord bot in Javascript as well as countless C# Unity and some C++ Unreal projects I work on and off on.
