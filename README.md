# Jack Patterson Github Account

### Hello, my name is Jack Patterson.
I am a third year student doing Computing with Games Devlopment in Muster Technological University Tralee.

I have experience in Java, C#, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Python and Kotlin. I like to just mess around in projects and challenge myself to see what I can do.
